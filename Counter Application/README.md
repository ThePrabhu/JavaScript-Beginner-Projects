📚 What I Learned

While building this project, I learned:

How to connect JavaScript with HTML and CSS.

Using DOM methods like getElementById.

Working with primitive data types and parseInt().

Using functions to structure logic.

Applying if/else conditionals in real-world scenarios.

Changing styles dynamically with JS (element.style.color).


This project gave me the “aha!” moment 🤯 — I finally felt how powerful JavaScript is when combined with HTML & CSS.
